QUESTION 3 OF 4

/*

Now it's your turn to create a constructor function. Declare a
`Sandwich` constructor function that takes three parameters:

1. `bread` (string) - the type of bread for the sandwich (e.g. "Wheat")
2. `meat` (array) - the meats to put on the sandwich
   (e.g. `[]` for a vegetarian sandwich!)
3. `vegetables` (array) - the vegetables to include in the sandwich

*/
function Sandwich(bread,meat,vegetables){
             this.bread = bread;
             this.meat = meat;
             this.vegetables = vegetables;
    
}

QUESTION 4 OF 4

Consider the following constructors:

function Finch(name) {
  this.kingdom = 'Animalia';
  this.name = name;
}

function Sparrow(name) {
  this.kingdom = 'Animalia';
  this.name = name;
}

Let's create an instance of each constructor:

const atticus = new Finch('Atticus');
const jack = new Sparrow('Jack');

What is the result when atticus instanceof Sparrow; is executed?

Answers:
false
